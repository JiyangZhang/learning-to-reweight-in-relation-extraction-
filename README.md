# learning-to-reweight-in-relation-extraction
This is a project that applies the learning strategy in the paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09050.pdf. 

We want to use it in the relation extraction area, hoping to deal with the noisy dataset problem.

## Software required

Python 2.7 PyTorch 0.4.0. tensorflow 1.12.0

## Dataset

I use the GIDS dataset, thanks to SharmisthaJat: https://github.com/SharmisthaJat/RE-DS-Word-Attention-Models

## Running command

```
python2.7 <file> <data directory> <train file name> <test file name> <dev file name> <word embedding file name>
```
