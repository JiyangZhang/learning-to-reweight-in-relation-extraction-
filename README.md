# learning-to-reweight-in-relation-extraction
This is a project that applies the learning strategy in this paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09050.pdf. 

We want to use it in the relation extraction area, hoping it will help to deal with the noisy dataset problem

The running command is
python2.7 <file> <data directory> <train file name> <test file name> <dev file name> <word embedding file name>
